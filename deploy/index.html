        <p>*Through our 4H program, we want to reach out to kids and teenagers/adults. NO barn seems willing to have
          kids around these days…</p>
        <p>*Helping someone who needs a new outlook experience the healing power of the horse spirit is secondary part
          of our mission, and the most powerful!! We view it as a community event; just being around horses lifts your
          spirits!!</p>
