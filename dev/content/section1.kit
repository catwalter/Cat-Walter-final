        <h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>
            *Solly Stables’ mission is to provide a unique equestrian experience, building self-confidence, fostering independence and caruing for horses by promoting compassion and learning through riding and educational experiences.
            *Solly Stables strives to achieve this mission regardless of a person's ability to contribute financially.
            *Through our 4H program, we want to reach out to kids and teenagers/adults. NO barn seems willing to have kids around these days…
            *Helping someone who needs a new outlook experience the healing power of the horse spirit is secondary part of our mission, and the most powerful!! We view it as a community event; just being around horses lifts your spirits!!
