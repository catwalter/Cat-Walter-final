        <h1>Donations and Volunteering</h1>
        <p>
            If you would like to donate to Solly Stables we have several ways you can help.
            Donate money for building improvements and maintenance by clicking on our gofundme link to the right on each page.
            We are always in need of supplies such as toilet paper, paper towels, soap, trash bags, cat foodâ€¦
            All donations are tax deductible.

            You would need to have a parent or guardian (if under 18)available for paperwork signing initially. And as long as you are 16 or older you don't need one to stay with you.
